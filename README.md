**Title** : **Crop Recommendation System**

Using machine learning algorithms and agricultural data, a fruit crop recommendation system can be developed to suggest optimal crops based on parameters such as soil nutrient levels (N, P, K), moisture content, temperature, and other environmental factors. By analyzing historical data and employing predictive models, the system can provide tailored recommendations to farmers, maximizing crop yield and minimizing resource wastage. Through continuous learning and adaptation, this system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.
